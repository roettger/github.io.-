# Querying a Knowlege Graph with SPARQL: WHEN Queries

== WHEN Queries: Timelines ==

These queries retrieve first publication dates of the french enlightenment novels making it possible to present the information in the form of a timeline.  

Let’s start with a simple example: The following query shows the first publication date (P7) of all the novels in the corpus.

'''Query to retrieve the first publication dates of all French novels 1750-1800'''

  SELECT ?item ?itemLabel ?value ?valueLabel 
  WHERE{
     ?item wdt:P7 #publication date 
           ?value
  
     SERVICE wikibase:label { bd:serviceParam wikibase:language "[AUTO_LANGUAGE],en". }
   }

Follow the TinyURL and let the query run by clicking on the "play"-Button. Above the table, you can click on the arrow next to the eye. In the drop-down menu that pops up, you can choose “timeline” from the menu in order to display the results on a timeline. Another way to display the results in the timeline view is to specify it in the query itself. You can simply insert ''#defaultView:Timeline'' on the beginning of your SPARQL query. You could also specify other visualizations, for example a ''#defaultView:BarChart'' (see example below). 

We can also combine information on first publications dates and a certain topic. Let's see how the thematic concept "travel" evolved over time: 

'''Query to retrieve the theme 'travel' over time in French novels 1750-1800'''

   #defaultView:BarChart
   SELECT ?date ?countTravel ?countAll (?countTravel / ?countAll AS ?rel)
   WHERE {
   {  
   SELECT ?date (count(*) AS ?countTravel)
   WHERE {
     ?item wdt:P7 ?date;
           wdt:P25 ?topic .
     ?topic rdfs:label ?topicLabel .
     filter(lang(?topicLabel) = "en")
     filter(lcase(?topicLabel) = "travel"@en)
   }
   GROUP BY ?date
 }
 {
   SELECT ?date (count(*) AS ?countAll)
   WHERE {
     ?item wdt:P7 ?date;
         wdt:P25 ?topic . 
     ?topic rdfs:label ?topicLabel .
     filter(lang(?topicLabel) = "en")
   }
   GROUP BY ?date
 }
 }

We could also have a look at all the themes in the corpus and their evolution over time, filtering out themes with no or only one occurence per year (?countyear > 1).

'''Query to retrieve all themes in French novels 1750-1800'''

  #defaultView:BarChart
  Select  (str(SAMPLE(year(?date))) as ?year) (count(?themelabel) as ?count) ?themelabel 
   WHERE{
   ?item wdt:P25 ?theme.
   ?theme rdfs:label ?themelabel .
   ?item wdt:P7 ?date .
   FILTER(lang(?themelabel) = "fr")
   BIND(str(year(?date)) as ?year)
   SERVICE wikibase:label {bd:serviceParam wikibase:language "{AUTO_LANGUAGE}","fr" .}
  }
  GROUP BY ?themelabel ?year ?count
  #having (?count> 1)
